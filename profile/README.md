# Sayo Project

The Sayo Project aims to promote the use of the effect system in Haskell by attempting to address the current challenges faced in Haskell's effect system landscape.

* **Objective 1 - Research on the 'Heftia' approach for next-gen Extensible Effect aimed at enhancing the treatment of higher-order effects**

    To breathe new life into the challenges of handling higher-order effects in the current Haskell effect system,
    we are conducting research and development on an effect-handler system based on the Heftia approach. This method is inspired by the [Hefty Algebras (Casper et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3571255). For a detailed exploration, visit the [Heftia repository](https://github.com/sayo-hs/heftia).
